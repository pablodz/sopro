# SoPro (next generation SOund PROcessing)

Sox is a great tool, but it's not easy to use. SoPro is a next generation sound processing tool that is easy to use and easy to extend. By now only audio files can be converted to other formats, but in the future more features will be added, like video processing, etc.

## Methods planned to be implemented

- [x] Chunked
- [x] Full memory
- Batch
- Streaming

## Roadmap

- [x] Audio file conversion
  - [+] Format conversion [Work in progress](docs/format_table.md)
  

  - [ ] Bitrate conversion
  - [ ] Channels conversion
  - [ ] Resampling (Downsampling, Upsampling)
    - [ ] Nearest neighbor
    - [ ] Linear interpolation
    - [ ] Sinc interpolation
    - [ ] Windowed sinc interpolation
    - [ ] Windowed sinc interpolation with prefiltering
    - [ ] Minimum phase reconstruction
    - [ ] Minimum phase reconstruction with prefiltering
    - [ ] Equiripple
